# Config options

### blur

- blur - whether or not the output video file will have motion blur
- blur amount - if blur is enabled, this is the amount of motion blur (0 = no blur, 1 = fully blend every frame together, 1+ = more blur/ghosting)
- blur output fps - if blur is enabled, this is the fps the output video will be. can be a framerate (e.g. 600) or a multiplier (e.g. 5x)
- blur weighting - weighting function to use when blending frames. options are listed below. also: [view weighting comparison graphs.](tests/plot_weighting_functions/weighting_functions.pdf)
  - equal - each frame is blended equally
  - gaussian_sym
  - vegas
  - pyramid
  - gaussian
  - ascending
  - descending
  - gaussian_reverse
  - custom weights - custom comma-separated frame weights, e.g. 5, 3, 3, 2, 1. higher numbers indicate frames being more visible when blending, lower numbers mean they are less so.

### interpolation

- interpolate - whether or not the input video file will be interpolated to a higher fps
- interpolated fps - if interpolate is enabled, this is the fps that the input file will be interpolated to (before blurring). can be a set fps number or a multiplier (append x to end e.g. `5x`)
- interpolation method - method used for interpolation:
  - Quality: RIFE > svp
  - Speed: svp > RIFE
  - Note: On macOS, SVP requires SVP Manager to be open or a red border will appear. It provides a 30-day trial, but then costs $24.99 for a lifetime license. RIFE can always be used however, but it is slower than SVP.

### pre-interpolation

- pre-interpolation - enable pre-interpolation using a more accurate but slower AI model before main interpolation
- pre-interpolated fps - FPS to pre-interpolate input video to (before blurring). can be a set fps number or a multiplier (append x to end e.g. `5x`)

### rendering

- quality - [crf](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264#crf) of the output video (may be different if using GPU encoding) - (0 = lossless quality, 51 = really bad)
- deduplicate - removes duplicate frames and generates new interpolated frames to take their place. fixes 'unsmooth' looking output caused by stuttering in recordings
- deduplicate range - amount of frames beyond the current frame to look for unique frames when deduplicating. make it higher if your footage is at a lower FPS than it should be (e.g. choppy 120fps gameplay recorded at 240fps), lower it if your blurred footage starts blurring static elements such as menu screens
- deduplicate threshold - threshold of movement that triggers deduplication. turn on debug in advanced and render a video to embed text showing the movement in each frame
- deduplicate method - method used for deduplication:
  - Quality: RIFE > svp
  - Speed: old > svp > RIFE
- preview - opens a render preview window
- detailed filenames - adds blur settings to generated filenames
- copy dates - copies over the modified date from the input file to the output file

### gpu acceleration

- gpu decoding - uses gpu when decoding
- gpu interpolation - uses gpu when interpolating
- gpu encoding - uses gpu when rendering
- gpu type (nvidia/amd/intel) - your gpu type

### timescale

- input timescale - timescale of the input video file (will be sped up/slowed down accordingly)
- output timescale - timescale of the output video file
- adjust timescaled audio pitch - will pitch shift audio when sped up/slowed down

### filters

- brightness - brightness of the output video
- saturation - saturation of the output video
- contrast - contrast of the output video

### advanced rendering

- video container - the output video container format (e.g. `mp4`, `mkv`, `avi`)
- custom ffmpeg filters - custom ffmpeg filters to be used when rendering (replaces gpu & quality options)
- debug - shows debug window, prints commands used by blur

### advanced blur

- blur weighting gaussian std dev - standard deviation used in the gaussian weighting
- blur weighting gaussian mean - mean used in the gaussian weighting
- blur weighting gaussian bound - bound used in the gaussian weighting

### advanced interpolation

- SVP interpolation preset - preset used for framerate interpolation when using SVP, one of:
  - weak (default) - _[explained further here](https://www.spirton.com/uploads/InterFrame/InterFrame2.html)_
  - film - _[explained further here](https://www.spirton.com/uploads/InterFrame/InterFrame2.html)_
  - smooth - _[explained further here](https://www.spirton.com/uploads/InterFrame/InterFrame2.html)_
  - default _(default svp settings)_
- SVP interpolation algorithm - algorithm used for framerate interpolation when using SVP, one of:

  - 13 - best overall quality and smoothness (default) - _[explained further here](https://www.spirton.com/uploads/InterFrame/InterFrame2.html)_
  - 23 - sometimes smoother than 13, but can result in smearing - _[explained further here](https://www.spirton.com/uploads/InterFrame/InterFrame2.html)_
  - 1 - _[explained further here](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow)_
  - 2 - _[explained further here](https://www.spirton.com/uploads/InterFrame/InterFrame2.html)_
  - 11 - _[explained further here](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow)_
  - 21 - _[explained further here](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow)_

- interpolation block size - block size used for framerate interpolation. higher block size = less accurate blur, will result in spaces around non-moving objects of the frame, also renders faster. lower block size = more accurate blur, but can result in artifacting, also slower. for higher framerate input videos lower block size can be better. options:

  - 4
  - 8 (default)
  - 16
  - 32

- interpolation mask area - mask amount used when interpolating. higher values can mean static objects are blurred less, but can also result in less smooth output (moving parts of the image can be mistaken for static parts and don't get blurred)

### manual svp override

You can customise the SVP interpolation settings even further by manually defining json parameters. [see here](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow) for explanations on settings

- manual svp: enables manual svp settings, true/false
- super string: json string used as input in [SVSuper](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow#SVSuper.28source.2C_params_string.29)
- vectors string: json string used as input in [SVAnalyse](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow#SVAnalyse.28super.2C_params_string.2C_.5Bsrc.5D:_clip.29)
- smooth string: json string used as input in [SVSmoothFps](https://www.svp-team.com/wiki/Manual:SVPflow#SVSmoothFps.28source.2C_super.2C_vectors.2C_params_string.2C_.5Bsar.5D:_float.2C_.5Bmt.5D:_integer.29)

These options are not visible by default, add them to your config and they will be used.
